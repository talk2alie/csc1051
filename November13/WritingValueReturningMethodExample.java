/**
 * Question: Write a method that gets a user's name from the keyboard and returns
 * it to a calling code. 
 * 
 * Constraint: the method should be accessible only in this class.
 * Then CALL that method inside the main method when the application starts
 * Assign the retuned value to a variable and then print a greeting
 * 
 * Note: This method is very similar to the void method we wrote earlier, except 
 * now, instead of printing the user's name, we return it and let a different 
 * code be responsible for greeting the user
